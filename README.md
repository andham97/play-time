# Play Time
This plugin tracks the total in-game time across sessions. As well as the in-game time for each day played with the plugin active.

## Features
* Track the in-game time across sessions.
* Import the in-game time outside the plugin through Hans in Lumbridge.

## Usage
Install the plugin from the Runelite plugin-hub and let the tracking begin. The data is stored locally on the device so playtime on other devices are not tracked. When you visit Hans the total time played is updated to match the reported time.

## Configuration
The two settings are used to customise what is displayed in the plugin as well as the precision of time shown. If experiencing low performance, switch off the "Show Seconds" setting to save some performance.

* Show Averages: Display the Week Average and Month Average calculations.
* Show Seconds: Show the times expressed with seconds as well as the standard day, hour, minute configuration.
